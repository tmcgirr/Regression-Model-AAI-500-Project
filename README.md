# AAI-500-FA22-Project
### USD Applied Artificial intelligence - AAI-500-FA22 - Final Project Team 4

This project aims to predict the housing price based on several features and serves as a simple project following the coursework in a program. (Revision of this project would aim to revisit feature selection to avoid multicollinearity, possible finetuning, and additional data preprocessing steps.)

Data
-----------------------------
[This](df_model_rand_houses_by_zip.csv) file contains the housing data and features that were cleaned and fed into the regression model

[This](Multiple_Linear_Model_B_Zipcode.ipynb) file contains the notebook that will go through the steps of cleaning the data, preparing the data for the regression model, training the model, scoring the model and additional predictions using the trained model.
